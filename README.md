## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are formed by the combination of two or more
candlesticks. Each candlestick represents a period of time, such as one
minute, one hour, or one day. The shape of the candlestick tells you
whether the price of the asset went up or down during that period of
time.

## Bullish Candlestick Patterns

-   **Hammer:** A hammer is a bullish candlestick pattern that indicates
    a potential reversal from a downtrend. It is formed by a long lower
    wick and a small body that is located near the high of the
    candlestick.
-   **Doji:** A doji is a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision
    in the market. It is formed by a small body that is located near the
    middle of the candlestick.
-   **Morning Star:** A morning star is a bullish candlestick pattern
    that indicates a potential reversal from a downtrend. It is formed
    by three candlesticks: a long bearish candlestick, a small-bodied
    candlestick, and a long bullish candlestick.

## Bearish Candlestick Patterns

-   **Hanging Man:** A hanging man is a bearish candlestick pattern that
    indicates a potential reversal from an uptrend. It is formed by a
    long lower wick and a small body that is located near the high of
    the candlestick.
-   **Evening Star:** An evening star is a bearish candlestick pattern
    that indicates a potential reversal from an uptrend. It is formed by
    three candlesticks: a long bullish candlestick, a small-bodied
    candlestick, and a long bearish candlestick.
